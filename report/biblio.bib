	describe semantics that are not captured well by the ontology languages
	commonly used in the Semantic Web. Measurement of the semantic similarity
	of concepts as well as the combination of concepts without shared
	properties are common human cognitive tasks. However, these operations
	present sources of difficulty for tools reliant upon set-theoretic
	and syllogistic reasoning on symbolic ontologies. In contrast, these

  abstract = {The modeling of concepts from a cognitive perspective is important for designing spatial information systems that interoperate with human users. Concept representations that are built using geometric and topological conceptual space structures are well suited for semantic similarity and concept combination operations. In addition, concepts that are more closely grounded in the physical world, such as many spatial concepts, have a natural fit with the geometric structure of conceptual spaces. Despite these apparent advantages, conceptual spaces are underutilized because existing formalizations of conceptual space theory have focused on individual aspects of the theory rather than the creation of a comprehensive algebra. In this paper we present a metric conceptual space algebra that is designed to facilitate the creation of conceptual space knowledge bases and inferencing systems. Conceptual regions are represented as convex polytopes and context is built in as a fundamental element. We demonstrate the applicability of the algebra to spatial information systems with a proof-of-concept application.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of detecting objects in still, gray-scale images. Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion. In evaluating object detection approaches, several important methodological issues arise that have not been satisfactorily addressed in the previous work. A secondary focus of this paper is to highlight these issues, and to develop rigorous evaluation standards for the object detection problem. A critical evaluation of our approach under the proposed standards is presented.},

We define a conceptual space to be a set of images or “voltage maps” on a compact sub plane, and equip it with pseudo-physiological notions of distance and betweenness. While our meso level representation is easily linked to higher and lower representations, we argue that its natural notion of geometry provides powerful additional tools for knowledge modelling and reasoning. As illustration, we offer an explanation of multi-dimensional experimental results which suggets distances follow different order Minkowski measures according to whether the dimentions are integral or separable.},

  abstract = {Representing cognitive processes remains one of the great research challenges. Many important application areas, such as clinical diagnosis, operate in an environment of relative magnitudes, counts, shapes, colours, etc. which are not well captured by current representational approaches. This paper presents conceptual spaces as a meso level representation for cognitive systems, between the high level symbolic representations and the subconceptual connectionist representations which have dominated {AI.} Conceptual spaces emphasize orders and measures and therefore naturally represent counts, magnitudes, and volumes. Taking Gärdenfors' decade-long investigation of conceptual spaces [Gärdenfors, Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought, {MIT} Press, 2000] as start point, the paper presents a formal foundation for conceptual spaces, shows how they are theoretically and practically linked to higher and lower representational levels, and develops dynamics which allow the orbits of states in the space to solve appropriate meso level reasoning tasks. Interpretations of conceptual spaces are given to illustrate the formal definitions and show the flexibility of the representation.},

We found that increasing target-distractor similarity and decreasing distractor-distractor similarity impaired search guidance and target verification, but that target-distractor similarity and heterogeneity/homogeneity interacted only in measures of guidance; distractor homogeneity lessens effects of target-distractor similarity by causing gaze to fixate the target sooner, not by speeding target detection following its fixation.},

	A model includes parts’ appearance, as well as location and scale

	using a simple Bayesian network with a central hidden node containing
	location and scale information, and nodes describing object parts.
	The model’s parameters, however, are optimized to reduce a loss function

	often use a small number of parts and features, while discriminative

  abstract = {Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy, perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science—classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded cognition—will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.},

	area-place (desert-oasis), time-occasion (February-Valentine’s Day),

	a general term that covers a variety of more specific relations.
	The exact nature of the relation is instantiated by the context in

  abstract = {A new cognitive architecture for artificial vision is proposed. The architecture, aimed at an autonomous intelligent system, is cognitive in the sense that several cognitive hypotheses have been postulated as guidelines for its design. The first one is the existence of a conceptual representation level between the subsymbolic level, that processes sensory data, and the linguistic level, that describes scenes by means of a high level language. The conceptual level plays the role of the interpretation domain for the symbols at the linguistic levels. A second cognitive hypothesis concerns the active role of a focus of attention mechanism in the link between the conceptual and the linguistic level: the exploration process of the perceived scene is driven by linguistic and associative expectations. This link is modeled as a time delay attractor neural network. Results are reported obtained by an experimental implementation of the architecture.},

These distances are particularly crucial, for example, in computational biology, image analysis, speech recognition, and information retrieval. Here, an assessment of the practical questions arising during selection of a 'good'' distance function has been left aside in favor of a comprehensive listing of the main available distances, a useful tool for the distance design community. This reader-friendly reference offers both independent introductions and definitions, while at the same time making cross-referencing easy through hyperlink-like boldfaced references to original definitions. This high-quality publication is a mix of reference resource and coffee-table book. A number of fascinating curiosities appear in this {'Who's} Who' of distances. Besides distances themselves, the authors have collected many distance-related notions and paradigms, giving applied mathematicians in other sectors easy access to those research tools that are arcane for non-specialists. What's more, they come in ready-to-use fashion. This, as well as the appearance of some distances in different contexts, will be a stimulus to new research."--Publisher's description.},

However, heterogeneities between distinct {SWS} representations pose strong limitations w.r.t. interoperability and reusability. Hence, semantic level mediation, i.e. mediation between concurrent semantic representations, is a key requirement to allow {SWS} matchmaking algorithms to compare capabilities of distinct {SWS.} In that, semantic level mediation requires to identify similarities across distinct {SWS} representations. Since current approaches to mediate between distinct service annotations rely either on manual one-to-one mappings or on semi-automatic mappings based on the exploitation of linguistic or structural similarities, these are perceived to be costly and error-prone. We propose a mediation approach enabling the implicit representation of similarities across distinct {SWS} by grounding these in so-called mediation spaces ({MS).} Given a set of {SWS} and their respective {MS} grounding, a general-purpose mediator automatically computes similarities to identify the most appropriate {SWS} for a given request. A prototypical application illustrates our approach.},

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around {EM.} This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well — for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.},

The concept is realized within a cross-layered compositional representation learned from the visual data. We show how similarity connections among discrete labels within and across hierarchical layers can be established in order to produce a set of layer-independent shape-terminals, i.e. shapinals. We thus break the traditional notion of hierarchies and show how the category-specific layers can make use of all the necessary features stemming from all hierarchical layers. This, on the one hand, brings higher generalization into the representation, yet on the other hand, it also encodes the notion of scales directly into the hierarchy, thus enabling a multi-scale representation of object categories. By focusing on shape information only, the approach is tested on the Caltech 101 dataset demonstrating good performance in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the relation between the system and the real world is always mediated by the user: the representations within the system do not keep any direct connection to the real world, besides those inside the user' mind. This scenario describes the so called symbol grounding problem in information systems, which refers to the general issue of connecting symbols in a symbol system to their analog manifestations in the real world. Symbol grounding strategies keep the relation between the external world and symbols within the system, providing improved support for description and procedures for automatic interpretation. In this paper, we present a grounding framework which incorporates notions of formal ontology in its core. The ontological characterization of the visual grounding relations should provide better criteria for deciding which domain entities can be grounded and how they can be grounded. Finally, we demonstrate the application of these ideas in an interpretation system in the Geology domain.},

	image a viewpoint–invariant, typically three–dimensional (3D) structure,
	such as object parts, or on mentally transforming two–dimensional
	(2D) views. To test how these processes might interact with each
	other, an experiment was performed in which observers discriminated
	images of novel, computer–generated, 3D objects, differing by rotations
	in 3D space and in the number of parts (in principle, a viewpoint–invariant,
	“non–accidental” property) or in the curvature, length or angle of
	join of their parts (in principle, each a viewpoint–dependent, metric
	property), such that the discriminatory cue varied along a common
	physical scale. Although differences in the number of parts were
	more readily discriminated than differences in metric properties,
	they showed almost exactly the same orientation dependence. Overall,
	visual performance proved remarkably lawful: for both long (2 s)
	and short (100 ms) display durations, it could be summarized by a
	simple, compact equation with one term representing generalized viewpoint–invariant
	parts–based processing of 3D object structure, including metric structure,
	and another term representing structure–invariant processing of 2D
	views. Object discriminability was determined by summing signals
	from these two independent processes.},

	One important long-term goal is to develop a naive or common sense

	wholes and their relations. In this paper, we work towards such a
	theory by presenting a classification of part-whole relations that
	is suitable for different cognitive tasks and give proposals for
	the representation and processing of these relations. In order to
	be independent of specific tasks like language understanding or the
	recognition of objects, we use structural properties to develop our
	classification.The paper starts with a brief overview of the mereological
	research in different disciplines and two examples of the role of
	part-whole relations in linguistics (possessive constructions) and
	knowledge processing (reasoning about objects). In the second section,
	we discuss two important approaches to mereological problems: the
	“Classical Extensional Mereology” as presented by Simons and the
	meronymic system of part-whole relations proposed by Winston, Chaffin
	and Hermann. Our own work is described in the third and last section.
	First, we discuss different kinds of wholes according to their inherent
	compositional structure; complexes, collections, and masses. Then
	partitions induced by or independent of the compositional structure
	of a whole are described, accompanied by proposals for their processing.},

  abstract = {Human assessments of similarity are fundamental to cognition because similarities in the world are revealing. Similarity plays a crucial role in making predictions because similar things usually behave similarly. From this perspective, psychological assessments of similarity are valuable to the extent that they provide grounds for predicting as many important aspects of our world as possible (Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, \& Thagard, 1986; see Dunbar \& Fugelsang, Chap. 29). As the similarity between A and B increases, so does the probability of correctly inferring that B has X upon knowing that A has X (Tenenbaum, 1999). This relation assumes we have no special knowledge related to property X. Empirically, Heit and Rubinstein (1994) showed that if we do know about the property, then this knowledge, rather than a one-size-fits-all similarity, is used to guide our inferences. For example, if people are asked to make an inference about an anatomical property, then anatomical similarities have more influence than behavioral similarities. Another argument for the importance of similarity in cognition is simply that it plays a significant role in psychological accounts of problem solving, memory, prediction, and categorization. A brief survey of the major approaches to, and models of, similarity is presented. To provide a partial balance to our largely historic focus on similarity, we conclude by raising some unanswered questions for the field. These questions are rooted in a desire to connect the study of similarity to cognition as a whole.},

It is based on highly general ontological notions drawn from philosophy, like essence, identity, and unity, which are used to elicit and characterize the intended meaning of properties, classes, and relations making up an ontology. These aspects are represented by formal metaproperties, which impose several constraints on the taxonomic relationships between concepts. The analysis of these constraints helps in evaluating and validating the choices made. In this chapter we present an informal overview of the philosophical notions involved and their role in {OntoClean}, review some common ontological pitfalls, and walk through the example that has appeared in pieces in previous papers and has been the basis of numerous tutorials and talks.},

Participants then had to decide which of two objects carried the same possessive noun phrase as the original: the one made entirely of new parts (that could be inferred to be continuous with the original) or one reassembled from the original parts (that could not be inferred to be continuous with the original). Participants often selected the object made of new parts, despite the radical transformation. However, the tendency to do so was significantly stronger (1) if the object was described as an animal than if it was described as an artifact, (2) if the animal's transformation lacked a human cause than if it possessed one, and (3) if the selection was made by adults or 7-year-olds than if it was made by 5-year-olds. The findings suggest that knowledge about specific kinds of objects and their canonical transformations exerts an increasingly powerful effect, over the course of development, upon people's tendency to rely on continuity as a criterion for attributing persistence to objects that undergo change.},

Chinese readers had a better awareness of the components of characters, which were not clearly separable to novices. This finding suggests that holistic processing is not a marker of general visual expertise; rather, holistic processing depends on the features of the stimuli and the tasks typically performed on them. In contrast, results for the left-side bias were similar to those obtained in studies of face perception. Chinese readers exhibited a left-side bias in the perception of mirror-symmetric characters, whereas novices did not; this effect was also reflected in eye fixations. Thus, the left-side bias may be a marker of visual expertise.},

This is an important issue, as it will be increasingly important for robots to communicate and effectively share knowledge to speed up learning as they become more ubiquitous. We use GaÂ¿rdenfors' conceptual spaces to represent objects as a fuzzy combination of properties such as color and texture, where properties themselves are represented as Gaussian Mixture Models in a metric space. We then use confusion matrices that are built using instances from each robot, obtained in a shared context, in order to learn mappings between the properties of each robot. These mappings are then used to transfer a concept from one robot to another, where the receiving robot was not previously trained on instances of the objects. We show in a {3D} simulation environment that these models can be successfully learned and concepts can be transferred between a ground robot and an aerial quadrotor robot.},

In such distributed systems, there are many different sources and types of information, which need to be coordinated and combined effectively. The problem of cooperative anchoring is (roughly) the problem of, in a distributed system, determining which items of information refer to the same objects, and combining these items accordingly. In this paper, we define a general computational framework for cooperative anchoring inspired by work on conceptual spaces and (single-robot) perceptual anchoring. We also discuss an implementation of this framework which uses tools from fuzzy logic, and we present an illustrative experiment.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in {3D} viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	problems associated with deriving useful information from retinal
	images. In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing
	three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three
	criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and
	sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation
	for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation’s design
	are considered, (i) the representation’s coordinate system, (ii)
	its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information
	used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation
	imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these
	design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation
	for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system,
	(ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have
	a modular organization. A representation based on a shape’s natural
	axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows
	directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a
	shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means
	for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii)
	a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to
	specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition
	involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii)
	various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description
	to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most
	important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively
	from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the
	information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied
	by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more
	information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out
	this constraint analysis is described.},

The parts correspond to {HOG} bundles, which are groupings of {HOG} features. Each part model is supplemented by an appearance model, which captures the global appearance of the object by using bags of words of {PHOW} features. The learning is invariant to scaling and in-plane rotations of the object, the number of parts is learnt automatically, and multiple models can be learnt to allow for variations of {3D} viewpoint or appearance. Through an experiment, we show that {3D} multi-view object recognition can be performed by a series of learnt {2D} models. The method is supervised but can learn models for multiple object viewpoints without these viewpoints being labeled in the training data. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets: (i) the {ETHZ} shape dataset, (ii) the {INRIA} horse dataset, and (iii) a multiple viewpoint car dataset. Our results on these datasets show proof of concept for our approach since they are superior or close to the state-of-the-art on all three datasets while we do not use any negative examples.},

It is shown that so-called aggregates composed of multiple parts and constrained primarily by temporal and spatial relations can be used to represent high-level concepts such as object configurations, occurrences, events, and episodes that are required in an application context. Scene interpretation is modelled as a stepwise process which exploits the taxonomical and compositional relations between aggregate concepts while incorporating visual evidence and contextual information. It is shown that aggregates can be represented by concept expressions of a description logic which provides a concrete-domain extension for quantitative temporal and spatial constraints. The analysis reveals that different kinds of representation constructs have to be carefully selected in order to provide for the required expressivity while retaining decidability in general as well as practical support from description logic system implementations in particular. Reasoning services of the {DL} system can be used as building blocks for the interpretation process, but additional information is required to generate preferred interpretations. A probabilistic model is sketched which can be integrated with the knowledge-based framework.},

	a representative set of patches from the image, evaluating a visual

	distribution of samples in descriptor space as a characterization

	moderate to large numbers of samples, random sampling gives equal
	or better classifiers than the sophisticated multiscale interest
	operators that are in common use. Although interest operators work
	well for small numbers of samples, the single most important factor
	governing performance is the number of patches sampled from the test
	image and ultimately interest operators can not provide enough patches

	can produce meaningful cognitive primitives from an array of image
	intensities we require a representation whose elements may be lawfully

	the perceptual organization people impose on the stimulus. Unfortunately,
	the representations that are currently available were originally
	developed for other purposes (e.g., physics, engineering) and have
	so far proven unsuitable for the problems of perception or common-sense
	reasoning. In answer to this problem we present a representation
	that has proven competent to accurately describe an extensive variety
	of natural forms (e.g., people, mountains, clouds, trees), as well
	as man-made forms, in a succinct and natural manner. The approach
	taken in this representational system is to describe scene structure
	at a scale that is similar to our naive perceptual notion of “a part,”
	by use of descriptions that reflect a possible formative history
	of the object, e.g., how the object might have been constructed from
	lumps of clay. For this representation to be useful it must be possible
	to recover such descriptions from image data; we show that the primitive
	elements of such descriptions may be recovered in an overconstrained
	and therefore reliable manner. We believe that this descriptive system
	makes an important contribution towards solving current problems
	in perceiving and reasoning about natural forms by allowing us to
	construct accurate descriptions that are extremely compact and that
	capture people’s intuitive notions about the part structure of three-dimensional

More recently, evidence for holistic processing—measured by interference from task-irrelevant parts—was obtained in novices, raising questions for its usefulness as a test of expertise. Indeed, recent studies use the same task to make opposite claims: One group of researchers found more interference in novices than experts for Chinese characters, while another found more interference in experts than novices with objects. Offering a resolution to this paradox, our work on the perception of musical notation suggests that expert and novice interference effects represent two ends of a continuum: Interference is initially strategic and contextual but becomes more automatic as holistic processing develops with the acquisition of perceptual expertise.},

In the new theory, domains are sets equipped with a measure, and a property is a measurable membership function on a domain. Concepts are sets of properties and their binary associations. A new notion of the degree of ambiguity of properties for a given reasoning task is used to focus attention upon properties having the greatest discrimination power. The theory is demonstrated on a maritime application involving the categorization of vessel routes.},

These empirical regularities are mathematically derivable from universal principles of natural kinds and probabilistic geometry that may, through evolutionary internalization, tend to govern the behaviors of all sentient organisms.},

Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap.},

Despite considerable effort across many disciplines and many specific advances, there is no comprehensive or well-accepted account of this ability.

New evidence indicates a period of rapid change in toddlers' visual object recognition between 18 and 24 months that is related to the learning of object names and to goal-directed action. Children appear to shift from recognition based on piecemeal fragments to recognition based on geometric representations of three-dimensional shape. These findings may lead to a more unified understanding of the processes that make human object recognition as impressive as it is.},

	from other levels in taxonomies of objects and of living things.
	The 4 studies show that (1) parts prevail at the basic level, (2)
	basic level categories differ by parts, (3) subordinate level categories
	share parts, and (4) parts vary in perceived goodness. It was found
	that part terms proliferated in Ss’ listings of attributes characterizing
	category members at the basic level, but were rarely listed at a
	general level. At a more specific level, fewer parts were listed,
	although more were judged to be true. Perceptual salience and functional
	significance both contributed to perceived part goodness. It is proposed
	that part configuration underlies the various empirical operations
	of perception, behavior, and communication that converge at the basic
	level. Part configuration underlies the perceptual measures because
	it determines the shapes of objects to a large degree. Parts underlie
	the behavioral tasks because most behavior is directed toward parts
	of objects. Labeling appears to follow the natural breaks of perception
	and behavior; consequently, part configuration also underlies communication
	measures. Because elements of more abstract taxonomies, such as scenes
	and events, can also be decomposed into parts, this analysis provides
	a bridge to organization in other domains of knowledge. (47 ref)

  abstractnote = {In this book, Shimon Ullman focuses on the proc-esses of high-level
	vision that deal with the interpretation and use of what is seen
	in the image. In particular, he examines two major problems. The
	first, object recognition and classification, involves recognizing
	objects despite large variations in appearance caused by changes
	in viewing position, illumination, occlusion, and object shape. The
	second, visual cognition, involves the extraction of shape properties
	and spatial relations in the course of performing visual tasks such
	as object manipulation, planning movements in the environment, or
	interpreting graphical material such as diagrams, graphs and maps.
	The book first takes up object recognition and develops a novel approach
	to the recognition of three-dimensional objects. It then studies
	a number of related issues in high-level vision, including object
	classification, scene segmentation, and visual cognition. Using computational
	considerations discussed throughout the book, along with psychophysical
	and biological data, the final chapter proposes a model for the general
	flow of information in the visual cortex. Understanding vision is
	a key problem in the brain sciences, human cognition, and artificial
	intelligence. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the theories
	developed in this work, High-Level Visionwill be of interest to readers
	in all three of these fields.},

  abstractnote = {A taxon-omy of part-whole or meronymic relations is developed to ex-plain
	the ordinary English-speaker’s use of the term “part of” and its
	cognates. The resulting classification yields six types of meronymic
	relations: 1. component-integral object (pedal-bike), 2. member-collection
	(ship-fleet), 3. portion-mass (slice-pie), 4. stuff-object (steel-car),
	5. feature-activity (paying-shopping), and 6. place-area (Everglades-Florida).
	Meronymic relations ore further distinguished from other inclusion
	relations, such as spatial inclusion, and class inclusion, and from
	several other semantic relations: attribution, attachment, and ownership.
	This taxonomy is then used to explain cases of apparent intransitivity
	in merological syllogisms, and standard form syllogisms whose premises
	express different inclusion relations. The data suggest that intransitivities
	arise due to equivocations between different types of semantic relations.
	These results are then explained by means of the relation element
	theory which accounts for the character and behavior of semantic
	relations in terms of more primitive relational elements. The inferential
	phenomena observed are then explained by means of a single principle
	of element matching.},
